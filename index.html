<p>Hi! My name is Prasshanth Srinivasan, and I write software. I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas
  with a Master's degree in Computer Science, and my interests in the fields of Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence.
  When I am not coding, I doodle around and call it sketching, and sometimes write poetry and short stories that the world will never lay eyes on. </p>
